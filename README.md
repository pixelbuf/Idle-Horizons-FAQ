## Core Game Systems

### Resources
**Q: My Stamina/Tickets are above the cap but still regenerating. Is this a bug?**  
A: No, this is intended behavior. The cap (like 100/100) only limits natural regeneration - it's the maximum amount that will regenerate over time. You can exceed this limit through other means like rewards, items, or event bonuses. For example, if you have 100/100 stamina and collect a +50 stamina reward, you'll have 150/100 stamina.

### Combat Mechanics
**Q: What is the difference between Armor and Resist?**  
A: Armor reduces physical damage (shown as red bar after fights), while Resist reduces magical damage (shown as blue bar after fights).

**Q: How does the mana system work?**  
A: Each basic attack performed by a hero generates 10 mana. Additionally, every time a hero takes damage >5% of their health, they gain 5 mana. This is increased to 10 when taking damage >20% of their health. When a hero reaches their mana threshold, they will cast their ability.

**Q: How does the crit system work? Can abilities crit?**  
A: All hero basic attacks can crit. Abilities are case by case, but generally magic based abilities don't crit and physical abilities generally crit if it's in the form of an individual attack (e.g. Prince)

### Heroes & Items
**Q: What is the maximum Hero level?**  
A: 100

**Q: What is the maximum Prestige level?**  
A: Max prestige is 10 for both Heroes and Artifacts. The first 3 prestige levels each unlock an additional item slot, and all levels increase ability effectiveness. Each prestige for a hero allows for an additional Skill Tree point.

**Q: Can I equip multiple items of the same type?**  
A: Yes, you can equip multiple copies of the same item type (like multiple bows) and they will all function normally with their full effects.

**Q: Does it matter which items you put on which heroes?**  
A: Yes, item choice matters depending on the hero's skills. Each item category (Helmets, Gloves, Swords, etc) have a fixed set of bonuses. Some heroes utilize specific stats better than others.

## Multiplayer Content

### Guild System
**Q: What happens when a guild leader leaves?**  
A: The system follows these steps to assign a new leader:
- First choice: An officer is selected to be the next leader
- If multiple officers exist, one is randomly chosen
- If there are no officers, any guild member can become leader through random selection

**Q: What happens if our guild leader is inactive?**  
A: Guild leaders inactive for more than 2 weeks can be requested to be manually removed by a member of PixelBuf support. This is currently a manual process and will take multiple days. Please reach out in the discord.

### Arena System
**Q: How does the trophy system work in Arena battles?**  
A: Every battle in the arena affects both players' trophy counts. When a player wins an attack, they gain trophies while their opponent loses trophies - regardless of who initiated the battle.

## Technical

### Performance Tips
**Q: How can I improve game performance if I'm experiencing lag?**  
A: There are two main settings that can help improve game performance:
- Mute SFX (Sound Effects) in the settings menu (Significant improvements)
- Disable projectiles in the settings menu (optional, but can help with stability)
